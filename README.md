# Smart Irrigation System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a Smart Irrigation System using IoT to automate irrigation based on soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. The system employs an ESP8266 NodeMCU, Arduino Uno, Soil Moisture Sensor, and DHT11 Sensor, which collect data and send it to a ThingSpeak server for real-time monitoring. A water pump is integrated to irrigate the field according to environmental conditions, ensuring efficient water usage.

Agriculture in India heavily relies on monsoons, which often lack sufficient water sources. The Smart Irrigation System addresses this challenge by utilizing IoT to monitor and adjust irrigation based on soil moisture and environmental factors. The system is controlled via a mobile app with ON/OFF buttons, allowing manual interaction to manage the water pump in the field. This innovative solution ensures optimal water distribution and supports sustainable farming practices.
